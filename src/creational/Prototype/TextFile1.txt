delegates the object duplication or cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned
prototype registry stores frequently accessed prototypes
prototype registry a centrlized place, a catalog for the prototypes you use and clone the most
Use the Prototype Pattern when your code should not depend on the concrete classes of the objects that you need to copy or duplicate
Will clone objects whithout	coupling them to theire concrete classes
will get rid of  repeated intilization code
will save resources and time
