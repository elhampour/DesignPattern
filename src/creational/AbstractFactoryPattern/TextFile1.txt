Allows you to produce families of related objects without specifiyng theire concrete classes
A Sigle facoty is not enough
hence we should scale-up the implmentation to use the abstract factory design pattern
Explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product we have 
Use it when your code needs to work with various families of related products
many designs start by using the factory method pattern and later evolve toward an Abstract factroy Design
follows the open-cloesed and single responsiblit principles
centrlizes the product creation code in one place in the program
