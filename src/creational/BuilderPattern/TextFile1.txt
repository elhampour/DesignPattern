produces different types and representations of an object using the same construction process
initialization of the many fields of this object is usually buried inside a monstrous constrcutor
extract the object construction or creation code out of its own class and move it to seperate objects called builders
Director defines the order in which we should call the constrcution steps so that we can reuse specific configurations of the products we are building
Directors are optional
Director hides the details of the product construction from the clent code
Builder Pattern seperate the construciton of an object from its representation
Builder Pattern create a builder class contianng the same fileds of the object you  need created
Builder Pattern add several setter-methods for these fileds, and a build method responsible for creating the obecjt
Builder Pattern think aboyut creaitng a direcotr if the same creation code is used to create serverl objects
